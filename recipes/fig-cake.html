            <li>1 cup fat-free evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped fresh figs</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped fresh figs</li>
            <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>To make the fig cake: Sift flour, salt, and baking powder together in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large mixing bowl with an electric beater until fluffy. Add egg and beat well. Add flour mixture alternately with evaporated milk. Fold in vanilla, almond extract, and 1 cup chopped figs.</li>
            <li>Spoon cake batter evenly into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cake layers on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>To make the fig filling: Combine 2 cups chopped figs, brown sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. Spread thinly between cooled cake layers and on top.</li>
        </ol>
